My project for the midterm is a mini-game. Using the arrow keys, you can control a zombie head and move it around the screen. There are two different colored balls that move around the screen, bouncing off the edges. Your goal is to move the zombie head to intercept or "catch" the black ball. When you successfully capture the black ball, you score points, and a screaming sound is triggered. However, you need to be careful to avoid the red colored balls. If you accedidentally intersect one, you trigger a yelling sound and the screen changes to display the message "Game Over" with your total score displayed underneath. To make the game more challenging, when your score hits certain values, another, faster, red ball is added. At that point, you have to try to catch the black ball while dodging two or three red balls.
